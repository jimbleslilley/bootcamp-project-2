Sources of data
1.	country_vaccinations_by_manufacturer.csv (COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress | Kaggle)
2.	vaccine_stocks.csv (COVID-19 Vaccine Companies : Stock Data | Kaggle)

Type of final production database
PostgresSQL

Plan
The intention is to look at two different sources of Covid 19 data: Vaccinations by manufacturers and vaccine stocks and then combining the data as one dataset onto one database. We intend to extract data from Kaggle, use Jupyter notebook and PgAdmin 4 to perform the coding and subsequently present the data in PgAdmin.
