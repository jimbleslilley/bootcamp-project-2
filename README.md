* vaccine_stocks.csv (COVID-19 Vaccine Companies : Stock Data | Kaggle)

## Type of final production database
PostgresSQL

## Plan
The intention is to look at two different sources of Covid 19 data: Vaccinations by manufacturers and vaccine stocks and then combining the data as one dataset onto one database. We intend to extract data from Kaggle, use Jupyter notebook and PgAdmin 4 to perform the coding and subsequently present the data in PgAdmin.

## Goal of the ETL 

The goal of this project is to be left with a dataset which can be used be a data analyist to conduct research into the production of the COVID-19 Vaccine by manufacterurs and the effect this had on their company's stocks. Whether this be through exploring whether the countries the manufacturer issued its vaccine to had an effect. Or the quantity of vaccine supplied had any observable change.
